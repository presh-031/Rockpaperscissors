### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript.
- Web APIs : DOM and setTimeout.

## Features

- Play unlimited rounds of rock-paper-scissors game against computer
- Each round is won by the first to score 5 points.

## How to use

- Choose your weapon by clicking either rock, paper or scissors.
- Once you choose your weapon, the computer automatically chooses its own weapon and the winner is announced and scores
- First to score 5 points wins a round.
- At the end of every round, click the play-again button to start a new round.
- You can play as many rounds as you want!

## Key-Learning

- This course helped me pratice the importance of state variables, as I had to use certain variables to keep track of the Player and Computer's scores. It is always better to have variables such as these, rather than to always rely on the dom.
